<center><b>This is Release 73, 2004-07-15</b></center><P /><hr /><p /><p />
What is WFC (Win32 Foundation Classes)? It is a set of C++ classes
built upon MFC that let you develop Win32 applications. It encapsulates
different groups of API's (like the Registry) into C++ classes
to reduce the learning curve. For the most part I don't want to
overlap MFC in functionality. However, I have a TCP/IP socket
class and so does MFC (but mine works in Console applications).
I am not the author of all of the code. If I've seen code that
I can use I've rolled it into WFC. There's a lot of classes that
encapsulate data structures. The reason for this is my programmers
are constantly having problems initializing structures that have
a data member holding the size of the structure (i.e. cbSize or
dwLength members). Microsoft doesn't do a real good job of pointing
out that you need to set the size of data structures <b>before</b>
calling API's. This leads to a lot of heartache for first-time
NT programmers (in my experience). Also, all members of the structures
are zeroed out before use. WFC will be extended as it is used in more and more applications.<p />
WFC contains no exception handling. Why? I hate exception handling.
It is a religious issue with me. I prefer to check for failure
all over the place.<p />How much does WFC cost? Nothing. BSD liscense. Please let me know of bugs or extensions
so I can roll them into the next release. Feel free to tell me some good news too!
