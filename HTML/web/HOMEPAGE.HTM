I'm just a simple little NT programmer. Most of the work I do
is remote controlling equipment in real time. I started out using
Windows 3.0. Then came 3.1 and then NT. I started using NT but
unfortunately, Microsoft didn't. I started using MFC but unfortunately,
Microsoft didn't (and <I><B>still</B></I> doesn't
as of Feb 5, 2000)
put any real
support for NT into MFC so I wrote a bunch of C++ classes to make
my life easier. Like all class libraries, mine grew. Now I'm giving
it away, I call it Win32 Foundation Classes.<P>

Here's a bunch of C++ classes that parse data coming from GPS receivers
(as well as from most marine electronics):
