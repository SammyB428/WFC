<H1>Release 35</H1>
I've added entity resolution to the 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/" TARGET="_parent">XML</A>
classes.

<H2>What's New</H2>
<B>CRandomNumberGenerator2</B> - Thanks go to 
Yehuda Hahn (ygh@cfsnet.com),
for turning me on to a fast random number
generator by using Mersenne Twister algorithms
developed by Makoto Matsutomo and
Takuji Nishimura of the Department of Mathematics,
Keio University, in
Japan (at
<A HREF="http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/matumoto/emt.html">http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/matumoto/emt.html</A>).

<H2>Bug Fixes/Enhancements</H2>

<B><A HREF="CNetwork.htm">CNetwork</A></B> - Fixed a bug, thanks to
Ullrich Pollahne (u.pollaehne@online.de),
where I was not allocating room for any stripped leading
backslashes in a server name in the <B>Open</B>() method.

<P>

<B><A HREF="CRAS.htm">CRemoteAccessService</A></B> - Fixed a bug, thanks to
Richard Wirth (r.wirth@wirthware.da-net.de),
where the <B>Open</B>() method could go into an endless loop.

<P>

<B><A HREF="CPing.htm">CPing</A></B> - Fixed a bug, thanks to
Curits Yanko (cyanko@ziplink.net),
where I was not thunking the call to
<CODE>inet_addr()</CODE>.

<P>

<B><A HREF="REGISTRY.htm">CRegistry</A></B> - Fixed a bug, thanks to
George Koukoulommatis (gemasoft@hol.gr),
where I was not calculating the size of a string buffer correctly.
I was incorrectly assuming that a character was only one byte
wide which is not UNICODE correct. This bug was in the
<B>SetStringArrayValue</B>() function.

<P>

<B><A HREF="SOCKETS.htm">CSimpleSocket</A></B> - Fixed
a bug in <B>SetAddress</B>() where the name and address
properties weren't being set if there was no DNS
entry for an IP address.

<P>

<B>Map2Def</B> - This is a sample utility that converts a MAP
file to a DEF file. I fixed it where it was not including
the timestamp in the resulting DEF file.

<P>

<B>XMLCheck</B> - This is a new sample utility that loads
an XML file and tells you if it is valid or not. If
it is not a valid file it will tell you exactly
where it failed (line number and column number).
