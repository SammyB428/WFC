<H1>WFC Technical Note 3 - Generating HTML Documentation</H1>
$Revision: 2 $ Last Modified $Date: 10/01/98 6:54a $<BR><HR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

WFC ships with all documentation included. The documentation
is in HTML format. The reason for this was to make the docs
as readable as possible. No special tool is used to create the
documentation. The HTML is embedded in the source code files
and is pulled out using the <CODE><B>HTML</B></CODE>
<A HREF="Samples.htm">sample</A> program.

<H2>Building the Extraction Tool</H2>

After you have extracted and built WFC (see
<A HREF="WTN002.htm">TechNote 2</A>
for details), you must build the <CODE><B>HTML</B></CODE>
tool. This tool will go through the source code files and
create the HTML documentation.

<H3>Build Steps</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Open the <CODE>\WFC\SAMPLE\HTML\HTML.DSW</CODE> project workspace.
<LI>Build the <CODE>Release</CODE> project.
<LI>Copy <CODE>HTML.EXE</CODE> to your system directory (i.e.
<CODE>C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32</CODE>)
</OL>

<H2>Creating HTML Documents</H2>

Open the <CODE>\WFC\HTML\Document.cmd</CODE> in a text editor.
Edit line 6, change <CODE>E:</CODE> to whatever drive
letter you installed WFC on.

<P>

OK, here comes the hard part. Open a command prompt and change directories to the
<CODE>WFC\HTML</CODE>
directory. Run the <CODE>Document.cmd</CODE> batch file. This will create the
online documentation. To get started, load the
<CODE><A HREF="wfc.htm">wfc.htm</A></CODE>
file in
your favorite browser. You will now be able to navigate the documentation 
just as though you were on Internet.
